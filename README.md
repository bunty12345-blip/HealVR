# HealVR: Pain Reduction using virtual reality!!!

This is currently our most ambitious research project.

Most of us experience Chronic Pain/Acute Pain at least once in our lifetime. 
Something which long lasts can be termed as chronic(e.g. Back Pain, neck pain).
This reduces work efficiency and overall output of each and every individual and most of the time affecting the natural flow of life.
With the market & social evolution the stress rate is also increasing on quadrupled rate.
Is there any Modern World Technology which can reduce these problems?

This app is intended for patients who are suffering from chronic or mild pain.
It helps the patient to reduce the pain psychologically through mesmerised 
Virtual environments and gameplay. It diverts the patient’s mind and gives psychological healing.

Reason

The reason behind choosing this technology was to make people understand to reduce the consumption of painkillers which 
have many side effects and to uplift the health conditions of patients, making them independent of medicine.

Researches are being done on virtual reality pain reduction and shown  positive result.
It depends on patient’s level of comfort with VR , how well he/she can adjust and interact in the virtual world.
In general our app will be highly efficient and easily accessible to each and every individual.
